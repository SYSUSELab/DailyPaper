    "title": "ICVul: A Well-labeled C/C++ Vulnerability Dataset with Comprehensive Metadata and VCCs",
    "abstract": "Machine learning-based software vulnerability detection requires high-quality datasets, which is essential for training effective models. To address challenges related to data label quality, diversity, and comprehensiveness, we constructed ICVul, a dataset emphasizing data quality and enriched with comprehensive metadata, including Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs). We began by filtering Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures from the NVD, retaining only those linked to GitHub fix commits. Then we extracted functions and files along with relevant metadata from these commits and used the SZZ algorithm to trace VCCs. To further enhance label reliability, we developed the ESC (Eliminate Suspicious Commit) technique, ensuring credible data labels. The dataset is stored in a relational-like database for improved usability and data integrity. Both ICVul and its construction framework are publicly accessible on GitHub, supporting research in related field.",
